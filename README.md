**Cyclist and User Management System for PCM**

This project is a Laravel-based web application designed to manage cyclists and users inspired by the dynamics of Pro Cycling Manager (PCM). The platform allows users to create, update, and analyze detailed profiles of cyclists, incorporating performance attributes such as climbing, sprinting, time-trialing, and other key metrics. 

The application supports various functionalities including:

- Comprehensive cyclist profiles with real-time data input.
- Specialized algorithms to calculate average performance ratings based on key metrics.
- User roles and permissions to facilitate multi-user access and management.
- Advanced filtering and searching for specific cyclist attributes or skillsets.

This system aims to provide a robust tool for cycling enthusiasts and managers looking to simulate and manage virtual teams with real-world cycling performance considerations.
